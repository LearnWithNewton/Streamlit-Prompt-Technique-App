## THE C.R.E.A.T.E FRAMEWORK

If you want to write an effective 
prompt, you need to brief ChatGPT 
properly.
Here’s a reminder of the different 
elements you should consider for 
your prompt.

### 1. **C**haracter

This is the role you want ChatGPT to 
play. It could be an expert, a celebrity, 
an artist or an idiot. Make it clear with 
an introductory statement.

> Sample Prompt : “You are an expert chef with 20 years 
experience and a Michelin star. You 
can create amazing and surprising 
dishes from the simplest of 
ingredients.”


### 2. **R**equest

This is the task you want ChatGPT to 
do for you. You clearer you are, the 
higher your chance of getting a great 
response. Give more information if 
you need to.

> Sample Prompt : “I want you to generate an amazing 
recipe just using the ingredients I 
have in my fridge and cupboards. 
Start by asking me what ingredients 
I have available.”

### 3. **E**xamples

It may help to give examples to help 
ChatGPT understand what it is trying 
to achieve. Lists of information can be 
particularly good.

> Sample Prompt : “Draw your inspiration from chefs 
like Marco Pierre White, Gordon 
Ramsey, Anne-Sophie Pic and 
Yannick Alléno.”

### 4. **A**dditions

You’ll often discover elements in the 
output that aren’t quite what you 
wanted. This is where you add some 
extra statements to help shape the 
results.

> Sample Prompt : “List the measurements in imperial 
units. Do not use all the ingredients - 
only use what you need for the dish. 
Do not suggest a recipe until I give 
you my ingredients. Ask for the 
ingredients and then wait for my 
response before answering.”

### 5. **T**ype of output

Tell ChatGPT exactly how to format 
y o u r o u t p u t . Y o u c a n h a v e 
paragraphs, bullet points, tables, 
poems, scripts and just about 
anything else. Make it clear how you 
want the output to be formatted.

> Sample Prompt : “Write your response as a recipe. 
Give me a recipe title, a 100 word 
paragraph describing the dish, a list 
of ingredients and simple-to-follow 
steps. Write it in plain English 
without jargon.”

### 6. **E**xtras

There are some powerful phrases you 
can add to your prompt to make it 
work better.

> Sample Prompts :

- “IGNORE EVERYTHING BEFORE THIS PROMPT.”
- “ASK ME QUESTIONS BEFORE YOU ANSWER.”
- “EXPLAIN YOUR THINKING.”
- “ACT UNLIKE A TYPICAL AI.”
